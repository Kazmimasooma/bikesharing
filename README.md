# Bikesharing

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis that one of the main stakeholders would want to see a bike trip analysis to help strengthen the plan. I'll use Pandas to convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype for this analysis. Then, utilising the changed datatype, I'll design a series of visualisations to: Display the amount of time bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. Display the number of bike journeys made by all riders and genders throughout each hour of each day of the week. Display the number of bike journeys taken by each user type and gender on each day of the week. Finally, for your final presentation and analysis, I will combine these new graphics with the two you developed in this lesson.

## Summary: 

In conclusion, we can observe that NYC Citi Bike had a total of 2,344,224 rides. 1,900,359 of these rides were taken by subscription members, while 443,865 were taken by ad hoc clients. Men made up 65 percent of known clients, while women made up 25 percent of known customers.Peak riding periods were bimodal, ranging from 6 to 10 a.m. and again from 4 to 7 p.m., which corresponded to regular working hours for both genders. The study also looked at the best pick-up and drop-off sites, independent of time. To further analyse the data, I would recommend including visualisations that displayed the top drop off and pick up locations based on peak times to determine which areas facilitated the increase in ridership use; this information could then be used to place pick-up and drop-off locations both within New York and Des Moines. The second visualisation that I would propose is the length of trip duration by gender; this could then be developed to identify why women riders accounted for a considerably lower number of rides than males, with a remedy put in place to promote women riders even more.
